you cant just log into git hub via cli
you need to add a token
to create a personal access token:
you can do this from the website to get a token like this:

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

but you need to type it in everytime, so to avoid that use command:

git config --global credential.helper cache

to cache the next password and username given

you may need to change or undo which you can by 

git config --global --unset credential.helper
